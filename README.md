# FreeWeather
To use the app, you will need to get a token from the weather service https://openweathermap.org

After that, a Token class is created with the get Token method in the FreeWeather\app\src\main\java\com\example folder\freeweather\data\weatherApi\
which should return the String type token you received from the weather site.
